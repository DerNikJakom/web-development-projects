# Dicee Web-App

After styling the page, I added some JavaScript code to change the dicee images to a random one when refreshing the page. After comparing the values the title changes to a message whoever won this duel.

### Challenge: Give a static website some logic so that the dices show random values when refreshing the site and the title changes to 'Player xyz wins!'
